# Day 05

**Date**: 11 sept, 2020
**Time spent**: 1 hour

## Summary of yesterday

- Finished [React Native Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ixPU-QkScoRBVxtPPzVjrQ) youtube playlist
- Learned about form handling & validation with [Formik](https://github.com/formium/formik) and [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)

## Learnings

I was suppose to start with the [React Native And Firebase Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy9JCsy2u97m-xWAxGwHZ2vITtj4qBKDm) series today. But a lot of things came up and I couldn't do anything except from reading articles about React Native and cross platform mobile development. I read the following articles

- [React Native at Soundcloud](https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/react-native-at-soundcloud). Old but very much relevant.
- [Announcing Jetpack compose](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/announcing-jetpack-compose-alpha.html). Very very recent
- [Pressable - React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable). A new component that allows us responds with various events handlers depending on how long the button was pressed.

I got a peep into the minds of engineers switching to cross platform technologies from Java/Swift. Most of the reasons were related to the current team's familiarity with web technologies, scarcity of mobile developers or the developer experience of web based tools.

## Challenges

- Not enough time to learn ‚åöüò≠

## Tomorrow's focus

- Tomorrow, I'll start learning with the [React Native And Firebase Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy9JCsy2u97m-xWAxGwHZ2vITtj4qBKDm). This is my second end-to-end tutorials and I hope to attain a certain level of mastery after this one.ü§ûüèæ
