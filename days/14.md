# Day 14

**Date**: 20 Sept, 2020
**Time spent**: 3 hours

## Summary of yesterday

- Read a few case React Native case studies

## Learnings

- Read a few more case studies. No notes today, but I managed to put out the [react-native-casestudies](https://github.com/vickOnRails/react-native-casestudies).

## Challenges

- It's been hard to find time to focus on writing react native code outside my day job, that's why I've been doing low-code stuff. I hope to resume writing code from tomorrow

## Tomorrow's focus

- I plan to continue with my regular tutorials.
