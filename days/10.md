- I was able to continue work on the [React Native Fashion](https://github.com/vickOnRails/react-native-fashion) UI Kit ([start commit](https://github.com/vickOnRails/react-native-fashion/commit/791d980d3fc46720da40cd4b3d09ba08b5b13f26), [end commit](https://github.com/vickOnRails/react-native-fashion/commit/d56b79ca32adce249985c17e32237c4c343e076c)).
- There wasn't a lot of new things to take note of, except [Williams](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC806fwFWpiLQV5y-qifzHnA) made use of [restyle](https://github.com/Shopify/restyle) from Shopify which is a system for building UI components in React Native.

### Using Restyle

Restyle helps us manage and enforce design constants in our react native app. We can define things like spacing, typography, breakpoints and restyle makes them accessible through the `theme`.

- **Setting up the theme**: Imagine we have a react-native component like this <br>

  ```js
  import React from "react";
  import { StyleSheet, View, Text } from "react-native";

  const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
      flex: 1,
      ...OtherStyles,
    },
    text: {
      fontSize: 20,
      ...OtherStyles,
    },
  });

  const App = () => {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>{title}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  };
  ```

- We can use `restyle` to make those constants available as components <br>. We first define a theme

  ```js
    import { createText, createTheme } from "@shopify/restyle";

    const theme = createTheme({
        colors: {
            textColor: "#C0C0D34",
        },
        breakpoints: {},
        spacing: {
            s: 8,
            m: 16,
            l: 24,
            xl: 40,
        },
        // Notice the textVariants object for text constants
        textVariants: {
            subText: {
                fontSize: 80,
                fontFamily: "SFProText-Bold",
                lineHeight: 80,
                color: "white",
                textAlign: "center",
            },
            heading: {
                fontSize: 28,
                fontFamily: "SFProText-SemiBold",
                color: "textColor",
            },
            heading2: {
                fontSize: 24,
                lineHeight: 30,
                fontFamily: "SFProText-Bold",
                color: "textColor",
            },
            body: {
                fontSize: 16,
                lineHeight: 24,
                fontFamily: "SFProText-Regular",
                color: "textColor",
            },
        },
    });

    export type Theme = typeof theme;

    // Create Text to replace the default React Native Text
    export const Text = createText<Theme>();
    export default theme;

  ```

- Then make use of it. Notice the keys for the `textVariants` object is the value of the `variant` prop on the `Text` component <br>

  ```js
  // import newly created Text from theme
  import { Text } from "./theme";
  import { View, StyleSheet } from "react-native";

  const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
      ...containerStyles,
    },
  });

  const App = () => {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text variant="subText">{title}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  };
  ```

- We can also use of `restyle` alongside the normal `react-native` styling like so <br>

  ```js
  // import newly created Text from theme
  import { Text } from "./theme";
  import { View, StyleSheet } from "react-native";

  const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {},
    text: {
      ...textStyles,
    },
  });

  const App = () => {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text variant="subText" styles={styles.text}>
          {title}
        </Text>
      </View>
    );
  };
  ```

## Challenges

- I faced an issue with [react-native-redash](https://github.com/wcandillon/react-native-redash). The tutorial made use of an older version `14.2.1`. I spent about an hour figuring out why the latest version didn't export the `useScrollHandler` hook ðŸ‘€
- Nothing else
