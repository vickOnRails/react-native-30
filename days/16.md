# Day 16

**Date**: 22 Sept, 2020
**Time spent**: 2 hours

## Summary of yesterday

- I added opacity to the onboarding slides yesterday using `react-native-animated`.

## Learnings

- I went ahead into the welcome screen today. There's not enough notes to take today too. Here's a video of showing the onboarding now with the welcome page. <br><br>

## Challenges

- There were not enough challenges today. The only one I had was with [restyle](https://github.com/Shopify/restyle). I had a `Box` component that normally takes a `flex` prop. The value of the prop should be a number and should be used like so... `flex={2}`. But I kept passing in a string value and my emulator was constantly crashing ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Naughty me.

## Tomorrow's focus

- Other parts of the onboarding flow. Signin, forgot password etc.
