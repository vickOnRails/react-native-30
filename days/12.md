**NB**: This note was written on 20.09.20 (Day 14).

- I wasn't able to do nothing on this day. I had an all night hackerthon so I decided I would just read a few articles on React Native. I'm also putting together a repo of react native case studies, so I'm just scouting for many articles on RN.

## Challenges

- Time

## Tomorrow's focus

- Continue with the Artsy UI clone
