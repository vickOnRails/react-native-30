# Day x

**Date**: 14th Sept, 2020
**Time spent**: 1 hour

## Summary of yesterday

- Finished module 01 of the React Native Fashion youtube playlist
- Successfully setup my react native environment (inc Android studio)

## Learnings

- I said I would get to video 4 of the [React Native Fashion]() youtube playlist today. That was a very unreasonable and unrealistic target😅. These particular series is so in-depth that I literally spent about 5 hours to follow through a 50mins video.

### How to use the <ScrollView/> element

```js
<ScrollView
  horizontal
  ref={scroll}
  snapToInterval={width}
  decelerationRate="fast"
  showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}
  bounces={false}
  scrollEventThrottle={1}
>
  {slides.map(({ title }, index) => (
    <Slide key={index} right={!!(index % 2)} {...{ title }} />
  ))}
</ScrollView>
```

### Using transform & translates

### Getting the viewport sizes (Width, Height) with Dimension

### Using Animated.ScrollView from 'react-native-gesture-handler' library

## Challenges

_As always, previous and pending challenges, approaches taken to overcome them. This part should be the bulkiest 🏃🏾‍♂️💨_

## Tomorrow's focus

_Give yourself a little more hope. Assure yourself that tomorrow will be better_
