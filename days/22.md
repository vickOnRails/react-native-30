# Day 22

**Date**: 28 Sept, 2020
**Time spent**: 3 hour

## Summary of yesterday

- Couldn't show up yesterday ðŸ˜¢

## Learnings

- The most insightful thing for me today was the way [William](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkOyNuxGl9jyhndcnbFcgNM81fZak7Rbw) implemented the input validations in RN. Making use of the `onBlur` & `onChangeText` props, alongside a custom `validator` function. It looks something like this <br> <br>

  ```js
  import React, { useState } from "react";
  import { TextInput as RNTextInput } from "react-native";

  const Valid = true;
  const Invalid = false;
  const Pristine = null;

  type InputState = typeof Valid | typeof Invalid | typeof Pristine;

  const TextInput = () => {
    // state for managing input
    const [input, setInput] = useState("");
    // state for managing validation
    const [state, setState] = useState < InputState > Pristine;

    // border color based on validity of input
    const borderColor =
      state === Pristine ? "grey" : state === Valid ? "primary" : "danger";

    // function to validate input
    const validator = (password: string) => password.length >= 6;

    // function to set input valid state
    const validate = () => {
      const valid = validator(val);
      setState(valid);
    };

    const onChangeText = (text: string) => {
      setInput(text);
    };

    return (
      <RNTextInput
        placeholder="Placeholder content"
        borderColor={reColor}
        borderWidth={1}
        onChangeText={onChangeText}
        onBlur={validate}
      />
    );
  };
  ```

- The idea is that the input field calls the `validate` function on the `onBlur` event. Meanwhile, normal keystrokes updates the input field value on the `onChangeText` event.

## Challenges

- My major challenge today was managing the keyboard. It was so funny, I didn't even realize keyboard management was a thing in native mobile development. I ended the day trying to debug. Here's what the issue looked like

## Tomorrow's focus

- I'll learn how keyboard management and control works in react native. I don't want all these uninvited keyboards messing up all of my apps ðŸ˜‰
