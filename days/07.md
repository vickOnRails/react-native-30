# Day x

**Date**: 13th Sept, 2020
**Time spent**: 5 hours

## Summary of yesterday

- Learned about the `Animated` component for handling animations in react native

## Learnings

**NB**: I didn't have a great experience with the [React Native + Firebase series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy9JCsy2u97m-xWAxGwHZ2vITtj4qBKDm) because it was too focused on firebase and google analytics. While they're very important for shipping mobile apps, I'm only interested in getting my hands dirty with UI code ATM. So I started searching for another tutorial on Youtube. I still documented my learnings anyways.

### React Native + Firebase

- This is my first tutorials bootstrapped with the `react-native cli` (not expo). It required a few installations and android studio setup. Iou can create a new react native project using the firebase template like so

  ```bash
  npx @react-native-community/cli init --template=@react-native-firebase/template reactnativefirebase
  ```

- The next step is to create a firebase project and download the `google-services.json` file which contains the configuration for the project.
- Then run the app with `npx react-native run-android` which starts the metro bundler and a device on your android emulator. Things didn't work as smoothly as they sound, but I'll leave that out to the challenges section.

### React Native Fashion

- Someone on Twitter pointed me towards [William Candillon's](https://www.youtube.com/c/wcandillon) youtube channel. I think I've stumbled on his content once or twice but never really went deep. He has this awesome series on building a UI kit with react native. I like it and I've decided to focus on it for a little time, possibly finish it.
- I started immediately and got the video no.2 on the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkOyNuxGl9jyhndcnbFcgNM81fZak7Rbw).

## Challenges

Before switching to William's tutorials, I had a few challenges. Even if I didn't use the previous tutorials, it helped me set up my android environment.

1.  `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices'.> No matching client found for package name 'com.reactnativefirebase'`: It took me about an hour to know that the `application_id` on firebase must match with the one in the `build.gradle`. It was renamed to `au.com.reactnativefirebase` (mistakenly) in the tutorials so I just blindly followed through. I fixed the issue by leaving the default configuration `com.reactnativefirebase`. <br><br>

2.  **Can't find symbol BuildConfig.Application_ID** <br>

    > error: cannot find symbol
    > BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID + ".reactnativefirebaseappinitprovider";
    > ^
    > symbol: variable APPLICATION_ID
    > location: class BuildConfig

    This one also left me confused for hours. After numerous stackoverflow tabs, I found this one explaining that `BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID` had to be replaced with `BuildConfig.LIBRARY_PACKAGE_NAME`. More info on [this thread](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/issues/3254) and [this one too](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/pull/3710#issue-424727420)
