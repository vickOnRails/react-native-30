### Form handling with Formik

- This was my first time using Formik in a React project. I know it's huge in React, but didn't know it could be used in React Native tooðŸ¤¯. Here's how to use in a RN project
  <br>

  ```js
  import React from "react";
  import { Alert, Button, TextInput, View, Text } from "react-native";
  import { Formik } from "formik";

  import { globalStyles } from "../styles/global";

  function ReviewForm() {
    return (
      <View style={globalStyles.container}>
        <Formik
          initialValues={{ rating: "" }}
          onSubmit={(values) => {
            console.log({ ...values });
          }}
        >
          {({ handleSubmit, handleChange, values }) => (
            <View>
              <TextInput
                multiline
                style={globalStyles.input}
                placeholder="Review (1-5)"
                onChangeText={handleChange("rating")}
                value={values.rating}
                keyboardType="numeric"
              />

              <Button title="Submit" onPress={handleSubmit} color="maroon" />
            </View>
          )}
        </Formik>
      </View>
    );
  }
  ```

### Form Validation With yup

- yup is a library for form validation that works perfectly with Formik. We just pass a schema into the `Formik` component and it handles the validation and logs error messages. We start by installing `yup`. `yarn add yup` . Then we use like so
  <br>

  ```js
  import * as yup from "yup";

  // generate the yup schema
  const schema = yup.object({
    title: yup.string().required().min(5),
    body: yup.string().required().min(10),
  });

  const FormComponent = () => {
      return (
        <View>
            // pass schema into Formik component
            <Formik
                onSubmit={...}
                validationSchema={schema}
            >
                {{ rest of formik children components... }}
            </Formik>
        </View>
      )
  }
  ```

## Challenges

- I spent a lot of time fixing bugs here and there and wasn't able to achieve that much. But then I finished the [React Native Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ixPU-QkScoRBVxtPPzVjrQ) which is a huge featðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

## Tomorrow's focus

- I found a new tutorial - [React Native And Firebase Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy9JCsy2u97m-xWAxGwHZ2vITtj4qBKDm). I hope to start with it tomorrow
