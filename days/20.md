# Day 20

**Date**: 26 Sept, 2020
**Time spent**: 1 hour

## Summary of yesterday

- Couldn't show up yesterday 😢

## Learnings

- I went ahead to add the login screen. It's crazy how impossible it has become to dedicate just 2-3 hours daily for this exercise. My day job is honestly a lot to deal with. I hope this coming week will be different. 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾

## Challenges

- None particularly

## Tomorrow's focus

- Other parts of the onboarding flow. Signin, forgot password etc.
