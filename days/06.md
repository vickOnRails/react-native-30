# Day x

**Date**: 12th Sept, 2020
**Time spent**: 1.5 hours

## Summary of yesterday

- Read a few articles about React Native performance

## Learnings

### Animated

- I got to the third video in the [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy9JCsy2u97m-xWAxGwHZ2vITtj4qBKDm) series today. I didn't really take any notes since almost everything was covered in the previous course. I feel like I know the basics now, so this might be the last end-to-end course I'll take on React Native. I have to start building actual stuff ðŸ› 
- I also read about animation in react native with the `Animated` component. It focuses on declarative relationships between inputs and outputs, configurable transforms in between, and start/stop methods to control time-based animation execution. I plan on explore more of it tomorrow.

## Challenges

- 2 hours everyday sounds very realistic, but it's crazy how hard it is to get that amount of time after my day job.

## Tomorrow's focus

- Round up the React Native with Firebase course
- Take a deeper look into animation in react native
