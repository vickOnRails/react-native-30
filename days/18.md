# Day 18

**Date**: 24 Sept, 2020
**Time spent**: 2 hours

## Summary of yesterday

- Couldn't show up yesterday ðŸ˜¢

## Learnings

- I used a few hours to read a few react native case studies. I also researched and added more articles to the [react-native-casestudies](https://github.com/vickOnRails/react-native-casestudies) repository. I think there are enough case studies now, but I'll also look to add more.

## Challenges

- None particularly

## Tomorrow's focus

- Other parts of the onboarding flow. Signin, forgot password etc.
