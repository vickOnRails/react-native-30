# Day 23

**Date**: 29 Sept, 2020
**Time spent**: 4 hour

## Summary of yesterday

- I learned about a way to validate input fields with the `onBlur` and `onChangeText` props.

## Learnings

- I stopped when I had a bug where my keyboard kept covering other parts the app screen. I did a little research on handling keyboard with the `KeyboardAvoidingView`. Unfortunately I couldn't go too deep because I picked up the frontend masters RN V2 workshop. Which I finished today! I couldn't take lots of notes because it was a walk over most of the basics.
- I learned a whole lot from the workshop. One phenomenal one is how data was fetched in the workshop. Here's an example

  ```js
  import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";
  import { FlatList } from "react-native";

  const URL = "https://color-palette-api.kadikraman.now.sh/palettes";

  const Component = () => {
    const [palette, setPalette] = useState([]);

    // Take note of the useCallback
    const handleFetchPalettes = useCallback(async () => {
      const response = await fetch(URL);

      if (response.ok) {
        const palettes = await response.json();
        setPalettes(palettes);
      }
    }, []);

    useEffect(() => {
      handleFetchPalettes();
    }, []);

    return (
      <FlatList data={palettes} renderItem={({ item }) => <PalettePreview />} />
    );
  };
  ```

- The idea is to use the `useCallback` to prevent creating a new function on component re-rendering. The first question that came to mind was how `useCallback` is similar to `useMemo` since they both return memoized data.
- The difference is that `useCallback` returns the same function if the dependencies haven't changed. While `useMemo` actually computes/executes the functions and only returns the result of the function. Here's [an article](https://medium.com/@jan.hesters/usecallback-vs-usememo-c23ad1dc60#:~:text=useCallback%20and%20useMemo%20both%20expect,function%20and%20returns%20the%20result.) with a more detailed explanation

## Challenges

- None for now. Still haven't figured out how to prevent the keyboard from covering the app layout.
