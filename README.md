I had a quick glance at React Native in 2018. A lot about mobile has changed, especially in react-native. I've decided to explore cross-platform mobile development with React Native and possibly Flutter.

My reasons are to get a feel of mobile development, understand trends, how people use mobile and gain more knowledge on non-web environments.

I'm beginning with a 30-days-of-react-native for the month of September. My goal for this month is to build a simple, open-source alarm clock in React Native.

## Rules

- Show up for at least 2 hours everyday
- Document everyday's activities in this format
  1. Time spent
  2. Summary of yesterday
  3. Learnings
  4. Challenges
  5. Tomorrow's focus

**Update (6/10/20)**: It's been incredibly difficult to commit to the this daily exercise (given my day job and other activities). My goal with this exercise was to absorb a lot of knowledge in the smallest time possible. Things got shaky after the first 20 days, while I wasn't pleased that, I'm totally grateful for what I've learned in this very short time. I'm currently working on the [alarm clock](https://github.com/vickOnRails/wakie) as part of my goal for this exercise.
